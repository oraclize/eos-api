Thanks to this __EOS API__, enriching your smart-contracts with external data using __Provable__ is very easy!

In C++ it is as simple as including the __`eos_api.hpp`__ library that you'll find in this repository.

This will provide your contract with functions like __`provable_query(...)`__, which make it trivial for you to leverage our oracle technology straight away.

Simply import __Provable__ into your contract like so:

```c++

#include "provable/eos_api.hpp"

```

To learn more about the Provable technology, please refer to our __[documentation here](https://docs.provable.xyz)__.

### CDT Compatiiblity

The `eos_api.hpp` library in the master branch is compatible with the EOSIO CDT 1.7.

The Provable API compatible with the CDT 1.6 and 1.4 can be found in corresponding branches.

### :computer: See It In Action!

For working examples of how to integrate the __Provable__ EOS API into your own smart-contracts, head on over to the __[Provable EOS Examples](https://github.com/provable-things/eos-examples)__ repository. Here you'll find various examples that use __Provable__ to feed smart-contracts with data from a variety of external sources.
